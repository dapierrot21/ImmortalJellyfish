            Turritopsis dohrnii, also known as the immortal jellyfish, is a
            species of small, biologically immortal jellyfish found worldwide in
            temperate to tropic waters. It is one of the few known cases of
            animals capable of reverting completely to a sexually immature,
            colonial stage after having reached sexual maturity as a solitary
            individual.

                      Turritopsis dohrnii was first discovered in the

                      dohrnii is generally found living in temperate to tropical
                      waters. They can be found in marinas or docks, on vessel

                    In response to physical damage or even starvation, they take
                    a leap back in their development process, transforming back
                    into a polyp. In a process that looks remarkably like
                    immortality, the born-again polyp colony eventually buds and
                    releases medusae that are genetically identical to the
                    injured adult. The cellular mechanism behind it—a rare
                    process known as transdifferentiation—is of particular
                    interest to scientists for its potential applications in
                    medicine. By undergoing transdifferentiation, an adult cell,
                    one that is specialized for a particular tissue, can become
                    an entirely different type of specialized cell. Its an
                    efficient way of cell recycling and an important area of
                    study in stem cell research that could help scientists
                    replace cells that have been damaged by disease.

                    I believe this creature does not have anything threatening
                    its place on earth yet. I believe once the science community
                    find ways to create the immortal effect the T.dohrnii
                    possess. Then maybe humans will be the reason behind
                    anything threatening for these creatures besides sea turtles
                    and pengins.

                      It is unknown how old the oldest immortal jellyfish is.

                    <li>
                      It is the only jellyfish species that does not remain in
                      the last stage, called the Medusa stage, until death.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The regeneration process is called “transdifferentiation”
                      and it occurs when the jellyfish cells convert to an
                      immature polyp state.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The species has also been found on the Atlantic Ocean side
                      of Panama, Spain and Japan. It has spread throughout the
                      world after getting caught in the ballast waters of
                      long-distance ocean cargo ships.

                    <li>
                      If it starves or gets sick in its immature state when its
                      called a polyp, it cannot regenerate and will die.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Turritopsis rubra and Nemopsis bachei are another type of
                      species that are similar to the immortal jellyfish.
